   Joint institution PhD in Bioinformatics on the reconstruction of cellular interactions in a nascent endosymbiotic system.  This research was co-supervised by Professor Max Telford (Professor of Zoology, EMBO YIP 2000) at University College London (UCL) and Professor Thomas Richards (Professor of Evolutionary Genomics, EMBO YIP 2012) at the Natural History Museum, London.  
   This research involved the development of novel machine learning and computational methods
   to analyse `single' cell metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets.  
   It involved the first use of these datasets in the study of non-model multi-eukaryote systems.
   Additionally, this work included extensive phylogenomic analyses and the use of 
   mass spectrometry data
   to recapitulate the metabolome of \textit{P. bursaria} and its algae. 

   The thesis was examined (and upgraded) by 
   Professor Saul Purton (Professor of Algal Biotechnology, UCL), Professor Andrew Roger (Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Evolution, Dalhousie) and Professor Nick Lane (Professor of Evolutionary Biochemistry, UCL).

     \end{tabbing}\vspace{-20pt}      
    Postdoctoral research post with Professor Thomas Richards at the University of
    Exeter. This research is partially based on the completion of PhD research, particularly,
    experimental induction of RNAi in \textit{P. bursaria} and automation of
    assembly optimisation using Bayesian hyperparameter selection methods. 
    Finally, this project also involves an analysis of protein transmembrane domain
    evolution between domains of life with deep recurrent neural networks.
